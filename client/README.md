## DESCRIPTION
        
- We worked on an application that allows us to use the MERN and RESTful attributes to create an app we feel would benefit us. This is the Anime Watchify Web Application. This application will allow users to save inputs regarding anime, leave reviews and rates, and comment on episodes regarding the all things anime. You'd be able to sign in or sign up into the web application and have access to saving anime's into a watchlist, like other people's comments/rates, and interact on a social media level within the app.

## PACKAGES

- Mongoose, MongoDB, Express, React, Apollo, and Cors


## INSTALATION
      
- No installations required afterwards to use this application. The only thing required within accessing the files is applying `npm i {all the packages listed above + Nodemon`.

## USAGE

- Upon accessing the web application, you'll see a pretty standard layout. Obvious features such as signing in or logging in will be available. You'll also see a search bar that allows you to search through the database of animes available. Also, You'll see the option the go through the list of all animes, and next to that is an option to add a comment/rating towards an anime. These are the necessary applications and features we initially planned to add to the web application.
